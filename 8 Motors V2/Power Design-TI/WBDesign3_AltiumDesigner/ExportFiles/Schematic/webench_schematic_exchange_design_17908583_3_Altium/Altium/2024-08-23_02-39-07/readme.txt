All files exported to: C:\\CADExport\\workspace\Altium\2024-08-23_02-39-07\2024-08-23_02-39-07
 
 
To import your new library part into Altium follow these steps:

1. After running the Ultra Librarian export for the first time,
you will need to copy the following files into an area where
they can be accessed for all future translations.  They are script
files that Altium will need to be able to find.
	a. UL_Form.dfm
	b. UL_Form.pas
	c. UL_Import.pas
	d. UL_Import.prjScr
	
2. Open Altium and choose "Run Script" from the File menu. When the
script window opens, navigate to the location of the files created
in step 1 and choose the UL_Import.prjScr file.

3. Select the UL_Form.pas file from the new project that has loaded in the
script window. This should cause a window to open asking for a *.txt file.

4. Navigate to and select the appropiate *.txt file of the desired libary.
The latest file produced with a date code if using the Ultra Librarian Free Reader
or other desktop software (for instance 2010-02-17_23-12-34.txt), or
"AltiumDesigner.txt" if using files downloaded from Ultralibrarian.com
or another online source.

5. The script will open a new Integraged Library project and import
the Ultra Librarian data into it.  When complete a message box
will pop up saying that import is done.

**    !!!!!!!!!!!!!        WARNING        !!!!!!!!!!!!!     **
**************************************************************

Besure to check the documentation layer, "Mechanical 3", for important information
that may seem to be missing or have not translated properly!


*** Please Note! For some styles of components, after the component has been
exported to Altium Designer, the footprint is not visible in the main library frame.
Please navigate to the PCB Library view by clicking on the "PCB Library" tab at the
bottom left side of the main library frame. Once you are in the PCB Library view,
please double click on the footprint name (which should be in the top left quadrant
of the screen). After double clicking, the footprint should appear and you should
now be able to use this footprint in your design. ***



*** Altium 19 has a bug within the font manager so we have defaulted a font in order to
successfully finish importing the library to version 19!***
